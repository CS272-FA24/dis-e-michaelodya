Step 1: Put all books into consideration for sorting
Step 2: Take the first and second book from all books in consideration. If there is only 1 book to be considered for a pair, go to Step 6
Step 3: If the first book is later in the alphabetic order than the second, swap them.
Step 4: Take to the next pair of books if able (2nd and 3rd, 3rd and 4th, etc). Then go to Step 3. Otherwise, proceed
Step 5: Do not consider the alphabetically later book from the current pair for the rest of the sort, then go to Step 2.
Step 6: The books have been fully sorted in alphabetic order!
